<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Professor in [Intelligent Media Analysis Group (IMAG)](https://imag-njust.net/), at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China. I received the Ph.D. degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China, under the supervisor Prof. Jinhui Tang, a leader professor of Intelligent Media Analysis Group (IMAG). From Aug. 2014 to Aug. 2015, I am also an visiting scholar supervised by Prof. Shuicheng Yan in [Learning and Vision Research Group](http://www.lv-nus.org/) at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore. I am and the CCF Senior Member, and ACM Member, and IEEE Senior Member.<br>
